## Reverse Integer - Unit Testing

This project contains the implementation and unit tests for reversing the digits of an integer, handling overflow conditions within the signed 32-bit integer range.

### Solution

The `Solution` class implements the method `reverse` which takes an integer `x` and returns the reversed integer. The test suite for the `Solution` class is implemented using the `unittest` library. It includes various tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the `reverse` method. The tests cover basic functionality and edge cases.

### Constraints

* `-2**31 <= x <= 2**31 - 1` 

### Finding and Reporting Bugs

During testing, if the input integer results in an overflow after reversing, the method returns `0`.  The tests `test_reverse_integer_overflow` and `test_reverse_integer_overflow_negative` ensure that this condition is correctly handled.

### Fixing Detected Bugs

The detected bug was a typo in the original `reverse` method where it was returning the wrong variable. The method has been corrected to return the `reversed_int` variable instead of a different one.


### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage
x = 123
solution = Solution()
reversed_x = solution.reverse(x)
print(f"The reversed integer is: {reversed_x}") # Output: The reversed integer is: 321```

Project Structure
solution.py: Contains the implementation of the Solution class and the reverse method.
app.py: Implements the Flask application that handles user input, reverses the integer, and displays the result.
test_solution.py: Contains the unit tests for the reverse method and the end-to-end tests for the Flask application.
index.html: The HTML template for the Flask application's user interface.
